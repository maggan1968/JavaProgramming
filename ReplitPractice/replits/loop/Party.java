/*
Imagine you have a party and need to form the list of the guests. (Assume you have at least one guest)

Ask for the first guest name.

Then ask does user want to enter one more guests.

If yes - take the next guest input

Please enter guest name:

Do you want to enter new guest name:

Please enter guest name:
Linda
Do you want to enter new guest name:

Guest's list: Nick, Linda
