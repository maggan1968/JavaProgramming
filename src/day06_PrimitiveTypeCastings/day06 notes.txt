Package name: day06_PrimitiveTypeCastings

Warmup tasks
	1. Create a class named BirthDay and create the following variable
			 name, birthDay(int), birthMonth(String), birthYear(int)

			 use concatenation to display the birthday of the person

			 	if  name = "John"
			 		birthDay = 25
			 	    birthMonth = "April"
			 	    birthYear = 1995;

			 	output:
			 		John was born on April/25/1995.
Primitive Type casting:

•Allows us to assign one primitive type value to another primitive type
•There are two types of primitive type castings: implicit and explicit castings
•Cast Operator is needed to manually convert a value

Implicit casting:

•Casting smaller primitive types to larger primitive types
•Implicitly done by the compiler

byte a = 25;                     short x = 1000;
int b = a;                       long y = (long)x;

Explicit casting:

•Casting larger primitive types to smaller primitive types
•Must be done explicitly

int a =100;                      long x= 2000;
byte b = (byte)a;                short y = (short)x;




Primitives:
	
	double > float > long > int > short > byte

	smaller primitives can be directly assigned to larger primitive type
	larger primitives can NOT be directly assigned to smaller primitive types (need to be casted manually)


Arithmetic Operators:


NAME           OPERATOR   PURPOSE & NOTES                              EXAMPLE        RESULT
ADDITION          +       Adds one value to another                     10+5           15
SUBTRACTION       -       Subtracts one value from another              10-5            5
DIVISION          /       Divides two values                            10/5            2
MULTIPLICATION    *       Multiplies two values                         10*5           50
MODULUS           %       Divides two values and returns the remainder  10%3            1
